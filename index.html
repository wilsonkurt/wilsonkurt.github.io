								<b><i>1. Climate Change & Human-Environment Interactions in the Central Andes</i></b><br>
								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Climate change and subsistence intensification along the Central Andean coasts</b><br>
								To better understand how changing ecological conditions may influence particular dietary / subsistence changes 
								in the Central Andes (Wilson et al. 2022, Sci Rep.) we are investigating the impacts of climatic and oceanic condition change
								on coastal individuals in the Central Andes. On the coast, variation in sea surface temperature (SST) and El Niño Southern Oscillation 
								(ENSO) events are expected to significantly alter the productivity of the near-shore marine environments. Condition changes which decrease 
								near-shore marine productivity through its impact on the upwelling of the Humboldt are predicted to incentivize subsistence intensification
								and increased use of non-marine resources. Using stable isotope reconstructions of diet as well as spatiotemporal reconstructions
								of oceanic (sea surface temperature, ENSO) and climatic (precipitation) we are testing these hypotheses across the past ~2500 years.<br> For more see:

									understanding subsistence, health, and status in past societies, yet systematic studies remain scarce. 
									Here we provided the first systematic quantitative inter-regional analysis of dietary variation in the prehistoric 
									Central Andes using stable isotope δ13C‰ and δ15N‰ values from ~1,700 individuals over the past 7,000 years to 1) 
									reconstruct long-term dietary trends and 2) assess the relative influence of climate and population size on long-
									term dietary homogenization.
									We coupled paleoclimatic data with relative estimates of past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon-
									dates and assessed their influence on dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for 
									interactions among predictors. Results reveal that Central Andean diets across elevational contexts are dominantly explained 
									by their local spatiotemporal climates. However, during the Late Horizon, diets across contexts converge, suggesting during 
									this period diet is strongly influenced by the interaction between changing local climates and political interconnectivity.
									Ongoing investigations from this work are exploring the specific interactions of particular aspects of climate change

								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Climate change and ecological influences on violence and violence avoidance in the Central Andes</b><br>
									Interpersonal and intergroup violence is an unfortunate reality within the human condition, and prehispanic agro-pastoral populations within
									the Central Andes exhibit some of the highest rates of violent trauma ever recorded. An individual's likelihood of exposure to violence 
									is comprised, generally, of factors driving others to commit violence and the individual's ability to engage in violence avoidance tactics.
									Using the Central Andes as a case study, collaborators and I are exploring how climate change and environmental conditions impact both of these sides
									of violence exposure. Our work is finding that, in the Central Andes, on the one hand a) climatic conditions favoring population growth that strains 
									resource bases may incentivize acts of violence as individuals compete for limited productive locations while, b) on the other hand, 
									as local resource conditions become more marginal and/or variable due to either climate degredation or population expansion individuals'
									are pushed towards economic risk reducing mobility strategies favoring more mobility which limits their ability to engage in more effective
									violence avoidance. Our work is ongoing, particularly focusing on the interplay of climate change, population growth or collapse, and how
									they interact to change the likelihoods of violence in the past and for predicting violence in the present/future.</font><br>

								<b><i>2. Socioecological Dynamics of Inequality </i></b></br>
								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Socioecological System Dynamics and the Emergence of Inequality</b><br> 
								This National Science Foundation funded project (NSF SPRF #2203767) is 
								investigating the human-environment interactions around	the emergence of inequality, particularly 
								seeking to: a) constrain uncertainty as to what factors are most influential in its cause and b) 
								evaluate the role climate change, via its influence on subsistence economic intensification, may play in 
								changing material inequality. Using paleoclimate reconstruction with settlement and subsistence 
								archaeological records this project is generating high-resolution datasets of climate, inequality, storage, and 
								intensification to explore the interconnected human-environment systems around inequality. 
								It is also serving as a case-study generating replicable methods and tools for application in
								the Central Andes and other regions around the world.</font><br><br>

								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Identifying key socioecological factors altering expression of egalitarianism and inequaliy among foragers</b><br> 
								Understanding what favors egalitarian versus non-egalitarian resource access and patterns of behavior is a longstanding topic of 
								interest, however it is exceedingly difficult to identify whether the absence of evidence of inequality in many archaeological cases is also evidence
								of absence. Further, many external causal factors have been nominated as driving forces incentivizing inequality. Here we build an agent-based model
								implementing ecological conditions, behavioral theory, and individual interactions to explore how changes in key environmental conditions may
								incentivize egalitarianism or inequality more strongly and link these with known archaeological and ethnographic cases of non-egalitarian foragers. 
								Preliminary results suggest the model is capable of explaining under what conditions we may expect both behaviors, more egalitarian or more unequal, 
								and that how heterogeneously distributed and predictable key subsistence resources are represent crucial external ecological factors that interact
								with human decisions to set payoffs structuring	behavioral outocmes.</font><br>

								Humans are reknown for their relatively unique social organization, including residing and co-operating with many non-kin, with much research exlporing
								the impacts such organization has had on the human condition. Collaborators and I are have been exploring conditions influencing how such patterns in organiztation
								may emerge, particularly as grouping and interaction are key influencers on inequality. Thus, we have been researching how human band sizes and interaction-rates 
								may be influenced by specific socioecological circumstances, particularly focusing on how the economy of scale of key subsistence resources may benefit cooperation 
								and how the availability and sustainability of these resources may incentivize different mobility strategies leading to big differences in how many people an individual
								may interact with over their lifetime and how frequently they may interact with new individuals. Preliminary results are calling attention to how 
								underlying socioecological conditions may set the stage for human prosociality and cooperation, precursors to more institutationalized inequality.

									With the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, we tested a Marginal Utility of Inequality hypothesis in ethnographically

									A comprehensive review of the flat-headed peccary (Platygonus compressus) record, with the addition of new radiocarbon dated 
									specimens, suggests final extinction of the taxon occurred during the Younger Dryas, between ~12,500 and ~12,000 cal B.P. While assumed 
									to have been numerous and common across North America, our work suggests peccaries were much more common in what is now the eastern United 
									States and may have been significantly less common in other locations. Further, simulations indicate that small increases in inter-birth interval 
									and/or piglet mortality could have resulted in rapid extinction of the taxon. The late Glacial shift to a nutrient decelerating mode of ecosystem 
									fueling and its concomitant effect on forage quality may have arrested reproductivity, negatively impacting survival.</font><br><br>

								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Socioecological Dynamics and the Emergence of Inequality</b><br>
								National Science Foundation, SPRF. This project develops a joint geographical and anthropological research program evaluating how environmental change and human economic 
									decisions influence each other to impact resource inequality among humans. Two key longstanding social science questions are investigated 
									here: 1) what drivers of material inequality are most influential and 2) given that inequality is a complex system, how can we effectively 
									evaluate the importance of drivers over space and time. Answering these questions helps inform us about how severe inequality came to be and 
									predict how it may change in the future. By applying new techniques, informed by existing theory, linking archaeological and 
									paleo-environmental data this research will provide new, replicable, approaches to understanding the relative importance of causes for 
									inequality that may be applied around the world and used for future prediction.<br><br>

								While inequality is multi-causal, much research has linked economic intensification, expending greater effort to obtain more returns from the same 
									spatial area, and privatization with increasing inequality. However, intensification and privatization themselves are multi-causal, influenced 
									by the interactions between the environment and human population size. Via implementation of a series of novel sub-models within an Approximate 
									Bayesian Computation (ABC) simulation approach, this research addresses these complexities by generating quantitative, empirical evaluations of 
									how the interactions of environmental change and productivity, population density, subsistence economy intensification (SEI), and privatization 
									influence the emergence of material inequality within a dynamic system. Crucially, this work will estimate which causes have the greatest impact
									on inequality, providing guidance for future research. Employing regional case studies, this project also generates new cross-comparative data on 
									inequality, SEI, and the scope of privatization within the inter-mountain west of North America. <br>

								<b>Submitted Grants:</b><br>
								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Isotopes, Salvage Archaeology, and Complexity (ISAC): Exploring the Human-Environment Interactions of Everyday People During the Rise 
									and Fall of Complex Civilizations on Peru’s North Coast</b><br>	University of Utah Vice President for Research Office. 
									The Peruvian North Coast is among the few places in the world that gave rise to early 
									complex civilizations, one of the most important transitions in human history. Despite this, relatively little is known about common people or their 
									role in the rise and fall of Andean civilizations. Further, there is a need to examine societal dynamics relative to human-environment interactions, 
									a topic largely overlooked in Peruvian studies. This need is driven by a combination of research programs focused on elites and a long history of 
									archaeological looting, partially de-contextualizing burial sites. Here we propose a field and pilot, isotope and radiocarbon dating project addressing 
									both concerns through reclamation archaeology. Specifically, we will validate the utility of molecular data from disinterred, skeletonized individuals in 
									looted, non-elite cemeteries on the North Coast. This research will illustrate a replicable research method and support an NSF grant with the potential to 
									generate the largest, comprehensive molecular study in Andean South America to date. Combined with environmental reconstruction and causal modeling, this 
									work will provide key insights into the human-environment and sociopolitical interactions of common people during the rise and collapse of early complex 
									civilizations.<br>

								<b>In Prep Grants:</b><br>
								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Intensification, Inequality, and Resilience: The Dynamic Responses of Human-Environment Systems to Climate Change</b><br>
								National Science Foundation, Human Networks and Data Science (HNDS). Current and future climate change is poised to significantly destabilize the planet’s 
									physical, biological, and social systems causing crises and forcing humanity to adapt or face widespread crises. Ongoing and future climate crises 
									will impact marginalized communities first, striking at some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet while limiting their options for adaptive 
									resilience, which are centered in the local natural capital and the latent social capital of their community networks. However, our understanding of 
									adaptive resilience dynamics are limited by the lack of cultural and ecological diversity and the narrow time-depth and climatic variation observed today. 
									To address these limitations, we propose developing a rigorous, network-based framework capable of assessing adaptive capacity under dynamic conditions. 
									To do this, we leverage approaches from the SBE fields of Geography and Archaeology. We apply this framework to a case study capturing over 2,000 years 
									of successful and unsuccessful human adaptation to severe climate change; thereby identifying key factors promoting community resilience across the 
									Southwestern United States. Specifically, we will couple social and climatological factors within a novel, replicable, network-based analysis, to evaluate 
									four key hypotheses about how people utilize investment, exchange, and migration to become more resilient to damaging climate changes. Crucially, this 
									project will create new methodological tools to advance research on how human network connectivity impacts societal resilience and will provide unique 
									insights into past small-scale farmer adaptive responses to climate change similar in scope to our projected climate future.<br>

								<font size = "-0.75"><b>Scaling the Central Andes</b><br>
								National Science Foundation, Human Environment and Geographical Sciences (HEGS). The proposed project seeks to understand causal effects of climate change on
									subsistence, population dynamics, and sociopolitical connectivity over the past 6,000 years in the Central Andes to better enable humanity's past
									to inform its present and future. Understanding the effects of climate change in the past and projecting those effects in the future remains challenging 
									for reasons of spatiotemporal scale and causal mechanisms that link climate change to human outcomes. By combining artificial intelligence
									driven climate downscaling, archaeological big data on stable isotopes, settlement patterns, and radiocarbon dates, and causal modeling computational 
									techniques this project will address the two key multiscalar challenges in exploring interactions between humans and environmental systems: scale and mechanism.
									The novel integration of two approaches is key to the SCA project and highlights the key intellectual merits. A ‘big data’ synthesis of isotopic dietary proxies
									over the long term provides a means of evaluating the relationship of changes in food production to climate effects, while downscaling allows linkage of macro-scale 
									climate dynamics to human-scale social, environmental, and biological responses in ways not otherwise possible - i.e., to examine the ways in which humans experience 
									and adapt to the multivalent effects of climate change. These scales will be further bridged by detailed analysis of three catchment-scale case studies for which additional 
									data can be brought to bear to explore factors conditioning human vulnerability and resilience to climate change through sociopolitical connectivity, mobility, and 
									population change.

								<b>Recent Courses:</b><br>
								<i>Anthropology 5500 Capstone: Hidden Research Skills</i><br>
								<font size = "-0.75">Anthropology, the comparative study of people and their ways of life across the full temporal and spatial range of the human experience, 
									enables undergraduate students to question, explore, understand, and communicate on the multi-faceted and incredible diversity of humanity. Effectively 
									doing so requires not only engagement with individuals, present or past, but communication of such engagement. The study of anthropology is of great interest 
									to many people, academics and non-academics alike. In this class we will be constructing new knowledge and learning how to communicate anthropological research 
									for academic and non-academic audiences. Through in-class work, faculty mentorship, and guided practice students will improve their skills in producing research, 
									writing scientifically, speaking about science, and workshopping their work. These skills are key for future academic and non-academic success. Student semester 
									projects and work will be tailored to their current career goals (NGO, governmental office, graduate schools, private corporation, etc.) and will offer the opportunity
									to develop research and communication that will further their entry into those fields.

								<i>Anth 6305 Advanced North American Prehistory</i><br>
								<font size = "-0.75">Since the arrival of Native Americans on this continent they exhibited tremendous adaptive abilities and impressive settlement successes. 
									Ranging from hunter-gatherers to mound-building farmers (and tons of variation in-between) these people settled the entire continent rapidly. The huge 
									variation in subsistence strategies, adaptation to environments, and cultural developments reflects the geographic diversity of North America and has 
									inspired many questions including but not limited to: Why are people territorial in some areas and not others? Why domesticate plants? Why form strongly 
									interconnected polities in some areas but not others? How do behaviors differ by age/sex/societal role? Why do some people never bother with ceramics? 
									Can reliance on fish really produce similar or greater levels of inequality as agriculture? How do you thrive in the arctic? In this course we investigate 
									the broad temporal and spatial depth of the archaeology of North America and explore and try to answer these (and more) questions.

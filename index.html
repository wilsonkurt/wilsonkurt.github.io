								<b>Research Interests:</b> <br>
								I am broadly interested in understanding human-environment interactions in situations of climatic change. 
								I maintain a particular interest in how interplay between human behaviors and local ecologies influence
								dietary change, inequality, territoriality, cooperation, and defense in human populations. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Methods Expertise:</b> <br>
								To explore these human-environment dynamics I apply statistical, geospatial and digital ecological, and 
								agent/individual based computer modeling techniques to ethnographic, behavioral, environmental, paleoecological, and 
								archaeological data.

								National Science Foundation SPRF #2203767 <i> Socioecological System Dynamics and the Emergence of Inequality</i><br> 
								<font size = "-0.75"> This project is investigating the human-environment interactions around
								the emergence of inequality, particularly seeking to a) constrain uncertainty as to what 
								factors are most influential in its cause and b) evaluate the role climate change, by influencing
								subsistence economic intensification, may play in changing material inequality.
								Using paleoclimate reconstruction with settlement and subsistence archaeological records 
								this project is generating high-resolution datasets of climate, inequality, storage, and 
								intensification to explore the interconnected human-environment systems around inequality.</font><br><br>

								<i>Climate change drives 7,000 years of dietary variation in the Central Andes</i>.<br>

								</span>
								<font size = "-0.65"> (Above: mid-elevation farmlands, highland puna, Amazonian rainforest, and Atacama Desert
									in the Central Andes)</font><br><br>
								<font size = "-0.75"> Explaining the factors that influence past dietary variation is critically important for 
									understanding subsistence, health, and status in past societies, yet systematic studies remain scarce. 
									Here we provided the first systematic quantitative inter-regional analysis of dietary variation in the prehistoric 
									Central Andes using stable isotope δ13C‰ and δ15N‰ values from ~1,700 individuals over the past 7,000 years to 1) 
									reconstruct long-term dietary trends and 2) assess the relative influence of climate and population size on long-
									term dietary homogenization. <br>
									We coupled paleoclimatic data with relative estimates of past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon-
									dates and assessed their influence on dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for 
									interactions among predictors. Results reveal that Central Andean diets across elevational contexts are dominantly explained 
									by their local spatiotemporal climates. However, during the Late Horizon, diets across contexts converge, suggesting during 
									this period diet is strongly influenced by the interaction between changing local climates and political interconnectivity.</font><br><br>

								<i>The environmental null: Documenting the changing influence of environment and inequality on Prehispanic Andean diets</i><br>
								<font size ="-0.75"> Using a database of isotope data for individuals from the Peruvian Andes and northern Chile (n = ~1600) broken 
									out into four time periods (Early Intermediate Period, Middle Horizon, Late Intermediate Period, Late Horizon) we compare 
									dietary changes over space and time with climatic reconstructions. Analysis reveals that the amount of diet explained by environment 
									varies over time, suggesting social influences on life have greater and lesser effects in different periods. In particular, we see 
									decreasing environmental influence over time in carbon isotopes, which may reflect changing sociopolitical influence on agricultural 
									production, redistribution of resources, and social importance of maize.</font><br><br>

								<font size ="-0.75">With the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, we tested a Marginal Utility of Inequality hypothesis in ethnographically 
									documented societies. Comparing the effects of environmental heterogeneity and circumscription on inequality reveals that 
									environmental circumscription and environmental heterogeneity predict the presence of social inequality. When resources are 
									unevenly distributed and/or it is difficult to leave the local area to establish oneself elsewhere, societies are more likely 
									to have inequality and internal stratification.</font><br><br>

								<i> Synthesis and assessment of the flat headed peccary record</i><br>
								<span class="image left">
								<image src = "images/FHP_results.jpg">
									</span>
								<font size ="-0.75">A comprehensive review of the flat-headed peccary (Platygonus compressus) record, with the addition of new radiocarbon dated 
									specimens, suggests final extinction of the taxon occurred during the Younger Dryas, between ~12,500 and ~12,000 cal B.P. While assumed 
									to have been numerous and common across North America, our work suggests peccaries were much more common in what is now the eastern United 
									States and may have been significantly less common in other locations. Further, simulations indicate that small increases in inter-birth interval 
									and/or piglet mortality could have resulted in rapid extinction of the taxon. The late Glacial shift to a nutrient decelerating mode of ecosystem 
									fueling and its concomitant effect on forage quality may have arrested reproductivity, negatively impacting survival.</font><br><br>
